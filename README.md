I built a simple online bookstore webpage using only HTML and CSS as a frontend learning project. The page included a clean layout with sections for featured books, categories, and a navigation menu. All styling was done using pure CSS to practice layout techniques, responsive design, and visual hierarchy. This project helped me strengthen my understanding of HTML structure and CSS styling without relying on any frameworks or JavaScript.
